This is the starting point for me to create a plane thats controlled by an ESP-32. 

Current state is just an example prototype of balancing functionality that would be useful for a glider. AKA it straightens out using Elavator, Ailerons, and rudder to attempt to control the pitch, roll, and yaw respectively.

Expect updates as I progress in the project.
